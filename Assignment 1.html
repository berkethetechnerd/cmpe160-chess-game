					<h2>1. Description</h2>

					In this project, you are expected to develop a chess game along
					with its Graphical User Interface (GUI). For the GUI as well as the
					game itself, you are required to use the Object Oriented
					Programming (OOP) principles you have learned so far. The GUI has
					to be completed using <i>java.swing</i> library. You are given an
					incomplete version of the project. Build and run the code you are
					given. You should see a chessboard with eight black and eight white
					pawns. Try to move the pawns by drag &amp; drop. Click on a pawn and
					drag the mouse to the square in front. In this game the player will
					be able to move and capture the opponent's pieces using such mouse
					movements.

					<h2>2. Code</h2>
					The source code that is provided to you consists of four classes.
					The <b>ChessFrame</b> class is a JFrame subclass and draws the
					chessboard to the frame using the logic shown in the following
					image. Examine the <b>ChessFrame.java</b> code. It is
					self-explanatory and has sufficient comments.

					<h2>3. Requirements</h2>

					You are expected to:

					<ol>
						<li>Implement the other Pieces:

							<p>
								There is an abstract class, <b>Piece</b>, which should contain
								all the common methods and variables of a chess piece. Its code
								is commented so that you can understand the purpose and workflow
								of each method. <b>Pawn</b> is a sample subclass of Piece.
								<b>ChessFrame</b> creates 16 instances of <b>Pawn</b> and
								puts them in their corresponding squares on the chessboard using
								<b>initializeChessBoard()</b> method. You should create a
								subclass of Piece for every other type of chess piece like
								Knight, Bishop, etc. Then, update the
								<b>initializeChessBoard()</b> method properly to put all the
								pieces in place.
							<p>
								<u>Note:</u> The shapes of the pieces do not need to be fine
								arts, but at least they should be recognizable. Take the
								<b>drawYourself</b> code of <b>Pawn</b> and make some small
								changes to it if you have to. Use basic drawings like: triangle,
								rectangle, oval, etc.
							<p>All the pieces should be able to move and capture properly
								according to the rules of Chess.
						</li>

						<li>Implement the Turn-Based Logic:

							<p>Currently the player (with the mouse) can move a white
								piece as much as (s)he wants repeatedly. Besides, a white pawn
								can capture a white pawn, and a black pawn can capture a black
								pawn. This is wrong. You should fix this. The player should be
								able to play one black one white piece in turn, and a piece
								should only be able to capture the opponent's piece.
							<p>
								<u>Hint:</u> To do this, you might want to add some methods to
								Piece.java, like getColor, etc. You might also want to add some
								class variables into the ChessFrame.java to record and update
								the turns. You must certainly modify the mouseReleased() method.
								How to achieve the goal is up to you.
						</li>

						<li>Fix the Pawn Behavior:

							<p>A pawn could move forward by two squares in its first
								movement. Currently this is not possible. You should fix this.
							<p>
								<u>Hint:</u> You might want to add some class variables and
								methods to Piece.java to achieve that.
						<li>Some pieces can not jump over the others:

							<p>In fact, only a Knight can jump over other pieces. A
								rook cannot do that, for instance. You should also
								take this into account.
						</li>
						<li>Give us an Advice:

							<p>A chess game could be designed-implemented in many
								ways/styles. According to your experience, write at least one
								suggestion/advice/comment to indicate how could we design this
								game code better (from OOP perspective). Write your suggestion
								as a comment to the top of MainClass.java code.
						</li>
